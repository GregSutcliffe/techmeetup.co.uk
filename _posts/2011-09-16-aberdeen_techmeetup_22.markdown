Social Media Week: The Student Designer Experience

Student Designers inspires design students to improve their employability through design
briefs, job opportunities and entrepreneurial advice, and matches them with UK and
international brands looking for innovative and highly effective student marketing opportunities.

Student Designersâ€™ multi-sided platform provides brands with three times the standard student market exposure, a huge increase in market engagement and transparent and traceable marketing spend.
At the same time, design students get unique opportunities to gain invaluable paid experience.

Student Designers complements these activities with Student Design Fairs, collaborative design
days; Creative Startup TV, a range of videos to help creatives startups; and the Student Designers Development Programme to mentor creative startups.

In his spare time, Alex studies Hung Ga Kung Fu, is the Aberdeen University Entrepreneur in Residence and volunteers to help groups and charities with digital marketing.
