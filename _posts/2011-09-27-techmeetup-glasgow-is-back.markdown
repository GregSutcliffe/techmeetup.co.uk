Hello everyone,

TechMeetup Glasgow is back after being away for simply too long. We know you missed it, and so did we. But here we are with a new venue and support by the School of Computing at the University of Glasgow. We’re returning with our tried and tested format but hope to make some cool changes in the near future.

Our new venue is on the <em>5th Floor</em> of the School of Computing, opposite the Boyd Orr building and Brel - a hundred yards from Hillhead Underground. We’re super excited about the new venue and its possibilities - <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/105264216629146094135/albums/5656950370108236593">take a look</a>.

We’ve got two talks lined up in October:

1.)  Chris McDermott (@chrisvmcd) presenting an overview of Kanban, a Japanese approach to scheduling software development based on car manufacturing and supermarket shopping.

2.) Eilidh Donaldson (@tweetsportcouk) telling us about the life and times of running a startup and where she aims to take Tweetsport, an innovative approach to location-based sports news.

There'll be beer and pizza as usual and plenty of time before, between, and after the talks to catch up on the latest tech news & gossip. As ever, the event is free and no sign-up is necessary.

We’ve received amazing support over the last month from a lot of folk in the community. Thanks for all the retweets and spreading of the word. Please keep doing it. It means a lot to us and is mightily appreciated.

We’d also like to thank Professor Roderick Murray-Smith for his support in making TechMeetup Glasgow possible once more.

See you next October 26th, 2011 at 6.30pm.
