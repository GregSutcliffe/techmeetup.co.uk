Boom,boom, boom, it's 2010 and time for the 1st TechMeetup Glasgow of the year. We've got two great speakers lined up with a great opportunity to meet both old and new tech acquaintances. As usual the great people at Wellness & Health Innovation are making it possible enjoy the evening with some pizza and beer.

The speakers this month once again span the technology world. Presenting this month are:

<strong>John Carlos</strong> presenting on the experiences of building <strong><a href="http://www.thisiscentralstation.com/">http://www.thisiscentralstation.com/</a></strong>, a creative social network for people interested in art, film and design

<strong>Jay Jagpal</strong> talking about <strong>Adobe Flash & Flex</strong>, how it can be used today and how it will drive <strong>iPhone</strong> and <strong>multitouch</strong> development tomorrow.

So if that sounds like a great line up, come along. We’re in the usual place, the glorious Saltire Centre at Caledonian University, at the usual time 7pm for beer & pizza. Talks start 8pm sharpish and we finish up by 10pm. If you’ve never attended a TechMeetup, don’t worry – we’re a friendly bunch. No need to pay, register, or even let us know that you’re coming. Just bring yourself, your bonne humeur, and your inquisitive tech-mind.
