How Vagrant will save me and my colleagues

I'll be talking on Vagrant http://vagrantup.com/ a tool for building and running virtual machines from the command line and how this is arguably better than using a tool like Virtual Box on its own. Come and see what it's all about and discuss why it might be a useful tool for you too.

As always, come for the talk and to meet people who share a passion for tech.
