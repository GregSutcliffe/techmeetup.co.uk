I'm going down to <a href="http://www.launch48.com/">Launch48</a> next week to check it out. It sounds like a really good weekend and I'm going to blindly advise that everyone should come. Launch48 is a little bit more than a hack weekend, and a little bit less than a full <a href="http://www.seedcamp.com">Seedcamp</a> week. But it looks like a great in-between and most bestly (yes) - it's <a href="http://www.launch48.com/about/">run by startup people</a> so you know it's not going to suck.

Convinced yet? Take a peek at their ridiculous sponsor list including Google, Sun, PayPal, TechCrunch and a few others - full list of names covering the weekend is <a href="http://www.launch48.com/">here</a>. They have a great panel of speakers and mentors who will help out during the weekend. You can either come down with an idea, or join a group for the weekend and hack together over the weekend. There doesn't seem to be any restrictions on project type as far as I can tell.

There weekend is split into two parts: guest speakers on Friday night (Launch48 Conference - £50) and then the whole weekend of building a web app/business with mentoring and lots of other developers (Launch48 Weekend - £10). You can get both for £60 but the guys at Launch48 have been very cool and given TechMeetup<strong> a promo code for 50% off</strong> - oooooh! It's limited in how many tickets it will work for but I don't know to how many - so it's first come first served. Go.
