TechMeetup Glasgow is back on the 5th Floor of the School of Computing on 26th of September from 6.30pm - thats' Tomorrow night! (Apologies for the last minute announce)

This months talks are two-fold:

Drawing for Developers: Canvas vs SVG, Kevin Brolly - @kevinbrolly
Start Sharing - Greq McQueen - @gregmcqueen

There'll be beer and pizza as usual and plenty of time before, between, and after the talks to catch up on the latest tech news & gossip. As ever, the event is free and no sign-up is necessary.

TechMeetup is made possible by the amazing financial support from the University of Glasgow (http://www.gla.ac.uk/), EdgeCase (http://edgecase.com/), ScottLogic (http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/), SkyScanner (http://www.skyscanner.net/) and small donations from community members. Thank you all.
