<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Next week will see us host the last TechMeetup Glasgow of 2009. Our usual 4th Wednesday of the month slot is a bit close to Christmas and I'm not sure if Dominos does a Turkey and Cranberry pizza (actually they probably will).</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">So this month we're going to make it an extra special and varied one with three speakers and three completely different topics.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Colin Urquhart, Founder & CEO of Dimensional Imaging (di3d.com), will talk about spinning his company out of Glasgow & Edinburgh University in 2003 into one of the world’s leading companies in human body 3D surface image capture, with applications ranging from facial surgery to video game character creation. Colin will conclude by introducing Dimensional Imaging’s new 4D surface image capture system, which extends its core 3D image capture technology into the 4th dimension of time.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Aaron Bassett doing a talk on GeoLocation APIs.</div>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">If you've never attended a TechMeetup, don't worry we're a friendly bunch. No need to pay, register, or even let us know that you're coming. Just bring yourself, your bonne humeur, and your inquisitive tech-mind.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">See you next week.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="overflow: hidden; position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">P.S. The videos from last month's TechMeetup Glasgow have been uploaded to the TechMeetup channel on Vimeo.</div>

Next week will see us host the last TechMeetup Glasgow of 2009. Our usual 4th Wednesday of the month slot is a bit close to Christmas and I'm not sure if Dominos does a Turkey and Cranberry pizza (actually they probably will).

So this month we're going to make it an extra special and varied one with two speakers and two completely different topics.

<strong>Colin Urquhart</strong>, Founder & CEO of Dimensional Imaging (<a href="http://www.di3d.com/">di3d.com</a>), will talk about spinning his company out of Glasgow & Edinburgh University in 2003 into one of the world’s leading companies in <strong>human body 3D surface image capture</strong>, with applications ranging from facial surgery to video game character creation. Colin will conclude by introducing Dimensional Imaging’s new 4D surface image capture system, which extends its core 3D image capture technology into the 4th dimension of time.

<strong>Aaron Bassett</strong> - <strong>It's four in the morning. Do you know where your users are? <span style="font-weight: normal;">Aaron will be looking at how you can use the new Geolocation API right now in your web apps to find your users locations. While concentrating on those clients which currently support this API (Firefox 3.5 & iPhone OS 3) Aaron will also show you how to use object detection and graceful degradation to fall back to a geo-ip lookup for those users whose web client has not yet implemented the Geolocation API.</span></strong>

We're in the usual place, the glorious Saltire Centre at Caledonian University, at the usual time 7pm for beer & pizza. Talks start 8pm sharpish and we finish up by 10pm.

If you've never attended a TechMeetup, don't worry - we're a friendly bunch. No need to pay, register, or even let us know that you're coming. Just bring yourself, your bonne humeur, and your inquisitive tech-mind.

See you next week.

P.S. The videos from last month's TechMeetup Glasgow have been uploaded to the <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/techmeetup">TechMeetup channel on Vimeo</a>.

P.P.S. You can download a map to the Saltire Centre from <a href="http://www.gcal.ac.uk/thesaltirecentre/global/contactmaps/maps.html">here</a>. We're in building "10".

P.P.P.S. We were premature in confirming our third speaker this month hence this post updated shortly after the original announcement.
