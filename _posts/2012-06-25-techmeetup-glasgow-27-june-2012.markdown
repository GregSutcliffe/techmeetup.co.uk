TechMeetup Glasgow is back on the 5th Floor of the School of Computing on 27th of June from 6.30pm.

This months talks are two-fold:

<strong>Design for Developers, Rich Quick</strong>
Rich's talk will cover how developers can apply the principles of good design to their work on graphical user interfaces.

<strong>Outside-in Development, Mike Borozdin</strong>
Outside-in development allows us, developers, to look at software from the end-user perspective. This results in achieving a greater level of customer satisfaction and producing more maintainable code. The talk will cover the essentials of outside-in development, its benefits, how to get started and the tools which can help you with that.

There'll be beer and pizza as usual and plenty of time before, between, and after the talks to catch up on the latest tech news & gossip. As ever, the event is free and no sign-up is necessary.

TechMeetup is made possible by the amazing financial support from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>, <a href="http://edgecase.com/">EdgeCase</a>, <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/">ScottLogic</a>, <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net/">SkyScanner</a> and small donations from community members. Thank you all.

See you next 27th of June, 2012 at 6.30pm.
