Techmeetup #7 will be held on Wednesday 19th May in the foyer of the North entrance to the Meston Building (<a style="color: #005488;" href="http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/information/informationforvisitors/" target="_blank">http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/information/informationforvisitors/</a>).

Pizza and beer will be served from 6:30pm onwards, talks start at around 8pm and no doubt there will be a trip to the pub at the end of the night.

We have another two great talks lined up this month:

Gordon Murrison of <a title="Open Planet Software" href="http://www.openplanetsoftware.com/">Open Planet Software</a> will be talking about the life-cycle of a product they've recently developed ...
<blockquote><strong>From 35,000 feet to a shipping product.</strong>
An all encompassing whirlwind tour of how we took an idea for a piece of software through to a shipping product.  We'll cover identifying the target audience, choosing features, some UI design decisions and our development process, including build automation and unit testing.</blockquote>
Martin Evans of <a title="Dome Web Design" href="http://www.domeweb.co.uk">Dome Website Design</a> will be doing an abridged version of his Ruby/Arduino talk from the Scottish Ruby Conference
<blockquote><strong>Arduino and Ruby</strong>
Using the Ruby Arduino Development gem, learn how to use Ruby in projects utilising the Arduino electronics prototyping platform. Discover how to interact with a variety of sensors and output devices to build a simple Robot.</blockquote>
Please remember that the entrance to Bedford Road is now blocked off with the new library going up.
