Hello everyone,

TechMeetup is taking place this Wednesday evening in Edinburgh and we've got a pretty sweet evening lined up. There's three talks:

1. Aimee Maree Forsstrom came all the way from Australia to talk about the OLPC XO laptops (aka One Laptop Per Child).She'll present the technology stack used (Sugar/Fedora-11/Python) and even bring 2 laptops for people to play with.

2.Brett Sheffield will talk about Spam and Backscatter.

3.Max Manders will give a talk on Yahoo developer tools and YQL.


There'll be beer and pizza as usual, so bring yourself and your opinionated friends and we'll see you at 6.30pm (Wednesday 11th) at Level 8 Appleton Tower.


See you all there.
