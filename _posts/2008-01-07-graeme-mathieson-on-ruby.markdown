Graeme Mathieson from Rubaidh with some anecdotes following his migration to Ruby and experiences on Ruby projects. Ruby(and Rails) have provided the tools and language that that web developers need to deploy applications quicker than ever, Ruby has also managed to build the same sense of community that made PHP the first choice for most developers until recent times, which was evident on Wednesday. Looking forward to seeing more cool things (slicehost, github, basecamp) from the ruby community in the near future.
