Once again TechMeetup will be held in the North Side Meston Building at Aberdeen Uni (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Meston+Building+Aberdeen+University&sll=57.294593,-2.400159&sspn=0.017437,0.034075&ie=UTF8&hq=Meston+Building+Aberdeen+University&hnear=&ll=57.166146,-2.105802&spn=0.004375,0.008519&z=17&iwloc=C">map</a>) from 6:30 onwards.

To make it easier to find out who the people around you are and what they're interested in we'll be using <a title="Bloop" href="http://www.getbloop.com">Bloop</a>. You can post messages (called bubbles) about what you would like to talk about or what you're looking for at the event and see what others are interested in talking about. Check out this fun intro for how it works <a title="how to use Bloop" href="http://blog.getbloop.com/how-to-use-bloop">how to use Bloop</a>.

Come along, have a beer and some pizza and listen to what should be two very interesting talks.

<strong>Alan Gardner</strong>

Ask a bunch of software developers about Behaviour Driven Development and some will say, "It's the natural successor to Test Driven Development!", others will say, "It *IS* Test Driven Development, the difference is merely semantics!", most will probably say, "What the fuzzy duck is Behaviour Driven Development?"

This talk aims to give a brief insight into BDD and will cover a (very) brief history of BDD, the goals and tenets of BDD and will hopefully have enough time towards the end for a quick example.

<strong>Dave Corsar</strong>

This talk will describe how the <a href="http://www.ist-alive.eu/">ALIVE-EU</a> approach to developing dynamic and robust software based on a service-oriented architecture is being adopted by CalicoJack, a Dundee based communication management company.  They are developing the back-end for a virtual communication device which attempts to ensure messages are sent to recipients via a channel appropriate to their current social context and the current availability of services which handle the sending a message, regardless of the message’s originating channel.  This means the phone call from your mother-in-law doesn’t interrupt your meeting but becomes an SMS message instead, while the same phone call, had it been on your train journey home does  arrive as a phone call. To achieve this, the ALIVE-EU framework harnesses knowledge technologies (ontologies), organisation theory, software agents, planning and Web services (including matchmaking) to provide complete working solutions of complex systems that are more like what we see in human societies.  The ALIVE-EU framework is also being used to support simulations of crisis management and urban information services.
