This Wednesday, 17 October, at 6:30pm we have a talk on the Facebook IPO lined up for you. We meet at 6:30 in the foyer of the North entrance to the Meston building with talks starting around 7pm.

Mark McCue from from Barclays Wealth Management shares his views on  "Facebook â€“ After the IPO what is the share price telling us?". Hopefully some day we will have an Aberdeen .com startup follow in Facebook's path.

As always, come for the talk and to meet people who share a passion for tech. As always there's also pizza, beer and soft drinks to aid the conversation.
