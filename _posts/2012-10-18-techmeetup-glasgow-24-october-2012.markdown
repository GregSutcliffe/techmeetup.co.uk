TechMeetup Glasgow is back on the 5th Floor of the School of Computing on 24 October from 6.30pm - thats' next Wednesday.

Celebrating our anniversary we've got a special startup-themed evening planned for you. This months talks are two-fold:

What's RookieOven all about?
You may have heard of RookieOven either through the blog or meetup but what is it actually trying to do any why? What's the motivation behind it, where is going and who is involved?" - Michael Hayes <a href="https://twitter.com/_mdhayes">@_mdhayes</a>

"Seeu.at: The idea, technology and future" - Jamie McHale <a href="https://twitter.com/jamiemchale">@jamiemchale</a>

There'll be beer and pizza as usual and plenty of time before, between, and after the talks to catch up on the latest tech news & gossip. As ever, the event is free and no sign-up is necessary.

TechMeetup is made possible by the amazing financial support from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/">University of Glasgow</a>, <a href="http://newcontext.com/">NewContext</a> , <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/">ScottLogic</a>, <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net">SkyScanner</a> and small donations from community members. Thank you all.

See you on the 24th of October, 2012 at 6.30pm.
