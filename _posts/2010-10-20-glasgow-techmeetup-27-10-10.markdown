Hello everyone,

TechMeetup is taking place on Wednesday the 27th October in Glasgow and we've got a pretty sweet evening lined up. There's three talks:

1. Colin Gemmel - Ruby on Rails:
Ruby on Rails has many great features that allow for some rapid application development. In this talk we will look at 5 of what I consider to be the best features just too wet your appetite for what rails can do and how quickly you can go from nothing to a working application.

2. Aaron Bassett - Django
Aaron will be discussing some amazing features of Django which don't get enough praise as well as a few add-ons and techniques to ease development.

There'll be beer and pizza as usual, so bring yourself and your friends and we'll see you at 7pm at GMAC, Level 5 @ 103 Trongate.

See you all there.
