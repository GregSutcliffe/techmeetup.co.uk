Another very enjoyable evening was had last night at Aberdeen's 4th TechMeetup with two very entertaining speakers, fuelled (at least in Alan's case) by a healthy supply of beer and pizza.

<strong>Behaviour-Driven Development</strong>

The first talk of the evening, given by Alan Gardner, was on behaviour-driven development (or BDD). Proposed by Dan North in 2003, BDD takes test-driven development's philosophy of fail, fix, refactor and applies it from the outside-in. Rather than starting at the model level and working outwards as test-driven development does, BDD creates tests directly from user requirement statements.

Alan finished his presentation by walking through a simple Cucumber/RSpec example.

<strong>The Alive Project</strong>

Dave Corsar was next up with his talk on the Alive project with which, through Aberdeen University, he is involved. The concepts behind this project are fairly abstract, but if I had to try I would say it is a robust and scalable framework for the provision of distributed services.

Dave illustrated this by providing a concrete example of a project being developed for <a href="http://www.calicojack.co.uk/">CalicoJack</a>. Here the requirement is for the system to choose the most appropriate method of communication with employees based on the urgency of the message, the current location of that employee and other pertinent considerations. Dave, used this example to describe how the three tier architecture of the framework could be applied to this problem.

Dave also mentioned briefly the use of the framework in a <a title="Thales" href="http://www.thalesgroup.com/">Thales</a> project in the development of a system to aid the evacuation of the Netherlands in the event of a flood.

The video's for the talk will be posted on Vimeo shortly.
