Come along to the May meeting and hear about Java ME in school and what you can do to catch PHP errors. As usual, you  get to meet and talk to interesting people and hear about cool ideas.

Using Sensor-Enabled Mobile Phones to Support Assistive Technology

This talk will describe a system that supports personal narrative for
children with complex communication needs. Typical users of the “How was
School Today...? - in the Wild” system are children who have not developed
speech and language skills as expected, due to motor, language, cognitive,
and/or sensory perceptual impairments (e.g., as a result of cerebral palsy).
The system generates a draft story based on data collected with a mobile
phone, and the children edit and tell the story using an appropriate user
interface. The talk will describe the functionality and architecture of the
system as well as practical issues which occur when deploying this sort of
system 'in the wild'.
