Happy new year and such. With the new year we’re ready to kick the talks off again and try some new things.

As always our talks are in the foyer at the north entrance to the Meston Building at the University of Aberdeen and start at 6:30pm when we gather for refreshments. The talks start about 7pm and wind up after discussion by 8pm when you’re able to continue talking and networking with others in more detail. Some might even retire to a pub.

To start things off we have Phil Leggetter talking about the Real-Time Web
http://www.leggetter.co.uk/

•	What is Real-Time? (not sure about this yet but I think it might help people move into the next point)
•	What is the Real-Time Web? (discuss)
•	When does Real-Time matter? (discuss)
•	Evolution of the Web: from Pull to Push
•	The technologies behind Push
•	Push Services &amp; Platforms
Following Phil’s talk we’ll explore some new ideas we have so be sure to come and join the fun. We look forward to seeing you there.
