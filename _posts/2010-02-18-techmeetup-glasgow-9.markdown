If you've never attended a TechMeetup, no worries, you're totally welcome. It doesn't cost anything and you don't need to sign up. Just bring yourself and your inquisitive mind - you'll find kindred souls talking tech in between bites of pizza and swigs of beer.</div>

So far we have one speaker confirmed and we're busily confirming our second speaker.</div>
