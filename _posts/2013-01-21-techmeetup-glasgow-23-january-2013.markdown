TechMeetup Glasgow is back on the 5th Floor of the School of Computing on 23 January from 6.30pm - thats' this Wednesday.

Back from our festive hiatus, this months talks are Games-tastic:

Making games on your phone - <a href="https://twitter.com/davesapien">@davesapien</a>
Dave will be talking about games development for anyone and everyone.
Making games directly on your device, the advantages and drawbacks
you'll face and the importance of removing the fear of starting game
development.
And the massive pain but "back to basics" approach for seasoned developers.
If your interested in getting started in games development, Dave will
break all the elements into easy to understand 'thingys' and 'dodads'.
Technical experience not required to enjoy this talk.

Space Station Silicon Valley: Diary of a Game Developer - <a href="https://twitter.com/grantsalvona">@grantsalvona</a>
Space Station Silicon Valley began development in September 1995 and was released on Nintendo 64 in October 1998. This talk gives an overview of the development process, the technologies used and the lessons learned.

There'll be beer and pizza as usual and plenty of time before, between, and after the talks to catch up on the latest tech news &amp; gossip. As ever, the event is free and no sign-up is necessary.

TechMeetup is made possible by the amazing financial support from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/">University of Glasgow</a>,
