It's a bit tough in Scotland getting seed funding for your web project, even though it's probably only a few thousand pounds you need to prove traction in the market. There's a few big names to help like  <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y-Combinator</a>,  <a href="http://www.eedcamp.com">Seedcamp</a>,  <a href="http://www.techstars.org">TechStars</a> but now, much more close to home there is  <a href="http://thedifferenceengine.eu">The Difference Engine</a>. These guys understand the web and what it takes to get your startup started and they provide Â£20,000 + three months of mentoring to get you started. They have just finished the first round of the program and are now taking in applications for their second tranche of companies - <u>the application deadline is 23 July 2010</u>.

On Wednesday at TechMeetup Edinburgh, The Difference Engine will be presenting to local startups and two of their recently graduated startups ( <a href="http://www.tagorize.com">Tagorize</a> and  <a href="http://www.geogoer.com">Geogoer</a>) will be talking about their experiences through the accelerator. If this is relevant to you, please come along and find out whatever you need to know to get yourself funded.
