"Waterfall is the forerunner of Software Development Methodology, while
Agile is often viewed as the Pretender. This has caused a protracted
period of debate between practitioners from both areas, thwarting many
change initiatives before they even get going.

In this presentation we'll get an insight of 'Agile in Action' presented
by a local based organisation that has gone through the move from
Waterfall to Agile, lending some valuable insights that will help those
who are thinking of taking or already on their way on the same journey."
