<p>Tech Meetup is back on the 8th floor of Appleton Tower from 6:30pm. </p>

<p>Eleanor McHugh is visiting, and talking about something - probably to do with Google Go. For more see <a href="http://techmeetuptalks.posterous.com/suggestions-for-20-minutes-of-hacker-baffleme">here</a>. Thanks to SkyScanner for paying her expenses and bringing her here  from London. </p>

<p>Michael Fourman will talk about WikiTopics. “We've been working for  some time on using topic-modelling (a form of machine learning that  generates 'topics' from a corpus of documents and assigns a few topics  to each document) to help organise and browse large collections of
documents. I will describe and demonstrate 'WikiTopics' a topic-browser for the cablegate collection of US cables. “ </p>


<p>I'm also hoping to confirm one more short talk for the night. </p>
