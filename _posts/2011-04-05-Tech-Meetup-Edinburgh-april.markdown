Tech Meetup returns to the 8th floor of Appleton Tower on Wednesday 13th for a very packed evening. Drinks and Pizza from 6:30pm!

Announcements from Social Innovation Camp, Culture Hack Scotland and all the usual suspects.

Side Projects draw to a close, as our intrepid workers return to tell us what they've learnt and what they've built. You'll hear about "I'd pay to see that!", Asteroids implemented in Clojure, an iPhone drinking app, <a href="http://learn-elisp-for-emacs.org/">http://learn-elisp-for-emacs.org/</a>, Twitter done right and a web fashion magazine.

Then some more speakers talking about their projects: Tom Beddard talks about <a href="http://fractal.io/">http://fractal.io/</a> and Gavin Robertson talks about <a href="http://www.okmyway.com/">http://www.okmyway.com/</a>

To finish the night up Jennie Lees, now working for Google, will be back in town and has kindly agreed to do a quick Q&A session.
