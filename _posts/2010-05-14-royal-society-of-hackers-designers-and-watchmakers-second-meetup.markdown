Tomorrow we're going to meet again to have another Royal Society of Hackers, Designers and Watchmakers.

In short, this "Royal Society" is just a chance for the web/tech/design people to meet and work together. It's for anyone who's working on side projects, or wants to get involved on some projects to come along and work together in the the ace little web/tech community we have here. It's not just for hackers, but also designers, product people, whoever really.

We've got a great space with free wifi, coffee, tables, chairs, and no public annoyances so we can just hack together some cool stuff. If you're working on side projects, or just want to work together with others, please come along - it'd be great to hang out.

See you there from 12 noon onwards.

Venue here: upstairs room in the Outhouse, Edinburgh (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=the+outhouse+edinburgh&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;hq=the+outhouse&amp;hnear=Edinburgh,+UK&amp;ll=55.959819,-3.187494&amp;spn=0.023735,0.077162&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A&amp;cid=5727061061103006245">map</a>)
