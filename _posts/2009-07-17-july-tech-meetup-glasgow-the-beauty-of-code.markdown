Following our TechMeetup Glasgow earlier in July with a 'Beauty of UI' theme, we switched around this time for a session on the Beauty of Code, with talks from Thomas Figg (aka Tef) on what it takes to build a computer language, and Craig Nicol on the applications of genetic algorithms.

Unfortunately Tef couldn't make it over, but we had a great session all the same - as always pizza and beer were enjoyed by all, and this was our first session in our new home <a title="Google Map of The Saltire Centre" href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=the+saltire+centre,+glasgow&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=20.068519,57.084961&ie=UTF8&ll=55.874131,-4.266043&spn=0.018539,0.055747&z=15&iwloc=A">The Saltire Centre</a> at Glasgow Caledonian University.
<h2>Craig Nicol on Genetic Algorithms</h2>
Craig provided a high-level introduction to what genetic algorithms are and how they can be used.

Genetic algorithms is a search technique used in computing to find exact or <span class="mw-redirect">approximate</span> solutions to optimization and search problems. As the name suggests, they're inspired by the process of evolution in the natural world.  The typical genetic algorithm consists of a genetic representation of the solution domain, and a fitness function for evaluating the solution domain.

Craig used example to clarify the topic and his presentation stimulated an interesting discussion of potential applications of the technology.
