Java Generics

In the Java Language, Generics have been with us for two major versions and is one of the most useful language features, but still sometimes causes confusion and refuses to play nice with features such as reflection, arrays, and var-args. In this talk I will be explaining the use of Java Generics and hope to demystify concepts such as type erasure, heap pollution, generic methods, type parameters, naming collisions, and the PECS mnemonic.
