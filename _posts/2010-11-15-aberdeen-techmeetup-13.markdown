Gordon Arthur present the talk:

Introduction to JQuery:

What is it and why is it so great?

How to get started with JQuery in your JavaScript and where you might use it.

We will also have a debate on a topic suggested by 'you' the participants. Tweet ideas to @scharlau or @mr_urf with #techmeetup tag.

Also, if you’re going to the Open Data masterclass, http://www.eventbrite.com/event/922941543 then you should have plenty of time between when that finishes around 4:45pm and we start up at 6:30pm. You can hang out in the Hub for coffee, or grab a pint in the St. Machar on the High Street.

In any case, if you’re here, then stick around for the talk in the evening.
