<p>This months Techmeetup is happening in a different location; Amazon's new offices on the lower ground floor of the Waverley Gate building (<a href="http://www.amazondc.com/contact-us">map</a>)</p>

<p>Two speakers (minor details still being confirmed):</p>

<p>Chris Rourke of <a href="http://www.uservision.co.uk/">User Vision</a> will provide an introduction to usability testing with practical and simple methods that can be performed by anyone.</p>

<p>Ann Marie Shillito from <a href="http://anarkik3d.co.uk/">Anarkik3d</a> will be talking about software for designers using haptic 3D mice.</p>

<p>There will be a long interval between the two, as both our speakers will be running demos. Chris will be running a user testing session with a volunteer from the audience. Ann will hopefully have several laptops and haptic 3D mice set up for you to play with.</p>

<p>Thanks to both our sponsors <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net/">SkyScanner</a> and <a href="http://www.amazondc.com/">Amazon</a> - both of which are hiring at the moment. </p>
