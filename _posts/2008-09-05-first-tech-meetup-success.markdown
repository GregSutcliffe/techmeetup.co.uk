Thanks to everyone who showed up yesterday! The tech meetup last night went great. We had a group of about 50 people all interested in technology, talking about technology. Even though there were many startuppers and some investors in the crowd, the business chat was to the minimum...

The two demos were great too. Tom Griffiths from <a href="http://www.hubdub.com/">Hubdub</a> gave a quick run through of their very popular website and some insight into prediction markets. Matt Aylett from <a href="http://www.cereproc.com">Cereproc</a> also gave a great demo of their Speech Synthesis software and how it can mimic George Bush as well as generate West Bromwich accents.

Special thanks goes to Andrew Mitchell, Colin Adams, and the University of Edinburgh for letting us use their space, and sponsoring the Pizza and Beer... The space on the eighth floor of Appleton Tower was actually very well liked by everyone.

I know many people couldn't make it to this event because of the short notice. I will do a more detailed post about what went on soon. But if you are interested in coming and meeting all sorts of cool techies, just drop us a line...
