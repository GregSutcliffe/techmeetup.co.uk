Thanasis Theocharidis who has been working on casual games for many years, gave a demo of his game "Crazy Space". <a href="http://www.dotredgames.com/index.php">Crazy Space</a> is a "Othello" inspired game which has been engineered ground-up. Thanasis wrote his own libraries for online AI calculations and fast hardware acceleration in Java. The game can also run on Google's new Android mobile platform.
