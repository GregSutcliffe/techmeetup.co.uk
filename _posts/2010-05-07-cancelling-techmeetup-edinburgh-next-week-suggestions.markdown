<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Right, need some help. Next weeks TechMeetup Edinburgh is looking to be a bit difficult to pull off - TechCrunch Edinburgh is on that evening (which I have to be at) and Hasan is away. There's a bunch of visitors coming to the city for all the events on next week and it might be quite tricky to have free reign up on Floor 8 of Appleton Tower (it's the Informatics Commercialisation suite and they'll likely have lots of meetings).</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">So, what do we do?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">1) Hands up who wants to have an event? I'll take silence to mean you don't mind if we cancel it.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">OR</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">2) Has anyone got suggestions and initiative to organise something else? For example it would be easy to arrange a hack evening, or a show-and-tell workshop (HTML5, MongoDB, Scala, iPad UI class) and maybe take things a bit more hands on for the evening.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">I'm sure we can still provide the beer and pizza if someone is willing to hijack the evening with a suitable alternative?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Please let's have this as an open discussion and not all going directly through me - please can you reply (and subscribe) to the TechMeetup Discussions Google Group (here) so we can email backwards and forwards to our hearts content.</div>

<span style="color: #333399;">UPDATE: TechMeetup is going ahead. It will take place in Appleton Tower at level 6 instead of level 8. We'll see you all there</span>.

Right, need some help. Next weeks TechMeetup Edinburgh is looking to be a bit difficult to pull off - TechCrunch Edinburgh is on that evening (which I have to be at) and Hasan is away. There's a bunch of visitors coming to the city for all the events on next week and it might be quite tricky to have free reign up on Floor 8 of Appleton Tower (it's the Informatics Commercialisation suite and they'll likely have lots of meetings).
<h2>So, what do we do?</h2>
1) Hands up who wants to have an event? I'll take silence to mean you don't mind if we cancel it.

OR

2) Has anyone got suggestions and initiative to organise something else? For example it would be easy to arrange a hack evening, or a show-and-tell workshop (HTML5, MongoDB, Scala, iPad UI class) and maybe take things a bit more hands on for the evening.

I'm sure we can still provide the beer and pizza if someone is willing to hijack the evening with a suitable alternative?

Please let's have this as an open discussion about it on the no-limits discussion board (not the announcement list) - please can you reply (and subscribe) to the TechMeetup Discussions Google Group (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/techmeetup-discussions/browse_thread/thread/17d870e0f537373c">the discussion thread is here</a>) so we can email backwards and forwards to our hearts content. Cheers all.
