April 2010 and TechMeetup Glasgow is back with a new sponsor <a href="http://www.interactivescotland.com/">Interactive Scotland</a>. We've been busily beavering away at signing up whole swathe of speakers for the next couple of months. For this month we've got two great speakers lined up:

<strong>Alistair Gunn</strong>, from <a href="http://www.interactivescotland.com/">Interactive Scotland</a>, will be explaining the background to the recently launched programme of developing digital media companies in Scotland, be they in gaming, smart phones, broadcast media or "all-of-the-above". This is your opportunity to sound Alistair out about the best way of taking an idea that you've been fostering to the next stage.

<strong>Craig Ramsay</strong>, from <a href="http://www.getcoderocket.com/">Rapid Quality Systems</a> in Dundee will be talking about <a href="http://www.getcoderocket.com/">Code Rocket</a> is a new plug-in for Visual Studio and Eclipse for designing, visualizing, and documenting code. Code Rocket generates fully editable flowchart and pseudocode designs of your code on the fly inside the IDE, fully synchronized with the code. The talk will provide an overview of what Code Rocket is and a demonstration of Code Rocket in action

So if you like the sound of it, come along. We’re in the usual place, the glorious Saltire Centre at Caledonian University, at the usual time: 7pm for beer & pizza.

Talks start 8pm sharpish and we finish up by 10pm. If you’ve never attended a TechMeetup, no worries, you’re totally welcome. It doesn’t cost anything and you don’t need to sign up. Just bring yourself and your inquisitive mind – you’ll find kindred souls talking tech in between bites of pizza and swigs of beer.

A massive thanks to our sponsors <a href="http://www.interactivescotland.com/">Interactive Scotland</a> for providing the beer and pizza, and to <a href="http://www.gcal.ac.uk/">Glasgow Caledonian University</a> for providing the terrific space.
