This month's TechMeetup will have a mobile app's theme. Craig Burnett will kick of the evening by showing us <a href="http://www.taxiapp.co.uk">taxiapp</a> and taking questions on how they built it.

The main speaker this month will be Kevin Mitchell  <a href="http://twitter.com/Mitchinator">@Mitchinator</a>  producer of the <a href="http://furrybootsapp.com/">FurryBoots App</a> Put your city in your pocket... . Kevin will talk us through the building of the application.

As always, come for the talk and to meet people who share a passion for tech. As always there's also pizza, beer and soft drinks to aid the conversation.
