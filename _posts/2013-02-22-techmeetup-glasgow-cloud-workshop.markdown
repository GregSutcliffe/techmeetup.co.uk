TechMeetup Glasgow is back on the 5th Floor of the School of Computing on 27 February from 6.30pm - thats' next Wednesday.

We're hosting a special Cloud Workshop event in conjunction with the University and we've got 3 speakers lined up:

<ol>
<li>Paul Gorman (VP software development, Kana) will talk about his experiences to date with the cloud.</li>
<li>Martin Sloan (Associate, Technology, Information and Outsourcing Group, Brodies Solicitors) will talk about some of the privacy and security aspects that need to be considered when moving to the cloud.</li>
<li>Derek Wang (Research Fellow, School of Computer Science, U of St Andrews) will talk about the web based toolkit he's been developing to analyse cost and revenues from different configurations in the cloud.</li>
</ol>

The format for the evening will be a very quick introduction, followed by the three talks (45 mins total), and then an open panel/Q&amp;A discussion session for the rest of the time. The panel will be made up of the three speakers plus Prof. Ian Sommerville from St Andrews, and Prof. Ian Allison from RGU (the two PIs on the project).

There'll be beer and pizza as usual and plenty of time before, after the talks and before the Q&amp;A to catch up on the latest tech news &amp; gossip. As ever, the event is free and no sign-up is necessary.

TechMeetup is made possible by the amazing financial support from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/">University of Glasgow</a>, <a href="http://http://www.neo.com/offices/uk/">Neo</a> , <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/">ScottLogic</a>, <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net">SkyScanner</a> and small donations from community members.
