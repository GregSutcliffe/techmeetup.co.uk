Rural community research with <a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/">FrontlineSMS</a> and <a href="http://www.mobiledatanow.com/">MobileDataNow</a>

"Is it possible for rural communities using mobile phones to redress a problem that started five centuries  ago? Yes, with luck anyway, my talk will outline how using SMS databases will tackle the problem of  the worldwide decline in mangroves and the loss of livelihoods associated with them  in developing countries. With open source software the research project will bring together data spanning 500 years, link communities and share knowledge that will help restore the balance within the mangrove ecosystems and their communities."
