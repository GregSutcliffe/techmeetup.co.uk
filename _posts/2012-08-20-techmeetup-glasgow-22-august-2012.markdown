TechMeetup Glasgow is back on the 5th Floor of the School of Computing on 22th of August from 6.30pm.

This months talks are two-fold:

Maria Farrell from the Open Rights Group will be talking about the Communications Data Bill and
having a Q&A on Internet Policy

Technologies for Health and Wellbeing – Lessons Learned through Co-designing with Older Users
Dr Marilyn McGee-Lennon will give a brief overview of some of the projects she has been working on recently and highlight the co-design methods that have worked (and haven’t) and reveal some tips about how these methods can be used to develop better interactive technologies and experiences.

There'll be beer and pizza as usual and plenty of time before, between, and after the talks to catch up on the latest tech news & gossip. As ever, the event is free and no sign-up is necessary.

TechMeetup is made possible by the amazing financial support from the University of Glasgow (http://www.gla.ac.uk/), EdgeCase (http://edgecase.com/), ScottLogic (http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/), SkyScanner (http://www.skyscanner.net/) and small donations from community members. Thank you all.

See you Wednesday 22th of August, 2012 at 6.30pm.
