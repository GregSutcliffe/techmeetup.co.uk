The second Wednesday of August is upon us, which means that it's time for another TechMeetup in Edinburgh. As usual, you'll be able to join us on <strong>August 12 from 6:30pm on level 8 of Appleton Tower</strong> (<a title="map of Appleton Tower" href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=10.445835,43.286133&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=55.945289,-3.186615&amp;spn=0.002415,0.010568&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A">map</a>) for an evening of talking tech whilst consuming copious amounts of pizza and beer. <strong>We have</strong> <strong>two talks lined up</strong>: one on programming the Microsoft Surface, and one on building a user-centered web.

<!--more-->Microsoft Surface is basically a coffee table with a 30-inch touch screen on top. It is scratch resistant and beer resistant (we've checked) but you can't put your feet under it.

<a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/">The School Of Informatics</a> hosted a <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/outreach/surface-competition/">Surface programming competition</a> this July. <strong>Kate Ho</strong> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kateho">@kateho</a>) & <strong>Neelima Alluri</strong>, winners of the competition will tell us everything they learned about programming those badboys. You'll be able to play with their apps too right there on a real Surface.

<strong>Ben Werdmuller</strong> (<a href="http://benwerd.com/">homepage</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/benwerd">@benwerd</a>) -- co-founder of <a href="http://http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a> among other things -- is coming up from London to join us & talk about a vision of the future of the web, as an open application framework based on permissive open standards, and centered around user-identities that are independent of a specific service provider, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google or anybody else. This would mean that the whole web itself would be a social networking tool, effectively turning the current model upside down.

Spread the word, and see you on Wednesday!
