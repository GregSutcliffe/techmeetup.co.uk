This Wednesday (16 January) at 6:30pm in the foyer at the North end of the Meston building we're talking about test driven development.

Will tell you why you want to use TDD to save you from sleepless nights, and run a short game to illustrate the basic principle.

<b>James Littlejohn <a href="http://twitter.com/aboynejames">@aboynejames</a></b>
Will tell you how to use TDD with Javascript.

As always, come for the talk and to meet people who share a passion for tech. As always there's also pizza, beer and soft drinks to aid the conversation.
