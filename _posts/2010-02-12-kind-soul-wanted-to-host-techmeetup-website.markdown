I wanted to do a quick shoutout for any kind souls willing to host www.techmeetup.co.uk or sponsor our hosting for another year. The site is very light and it really doesn't cost much - heavy things like videos are hosted with Vimeo.

Of course we'll acknowledge the kind party who helps us out and we'll give you a free t-shirt. It'll be a second hand Seedcamp t-shirt. TechMeetup doesn't have any.
