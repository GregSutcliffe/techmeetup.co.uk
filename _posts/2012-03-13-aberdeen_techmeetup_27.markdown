<h3>Why not Linux?</h3>

"If your currently using Windows and keep hitting the same problems when programming, have you thought about using Linux?

We'll have a quick run through on how to set it up and get it installed using VMWare, then show you how to get it ready for ruby and rails And along the way we'll explain how it solves problems."

As always, come for the talk and to meet people who share a passion for tech.
