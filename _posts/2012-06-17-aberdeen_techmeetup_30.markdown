<h3>Pie Night with two servings of Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stevenmilne">Steven Milne</a> will talk about "the setup of the RPi for my sons, how it relates to my own first experiences with computers, the software available, and how I see it fitting into their computing landscape.
