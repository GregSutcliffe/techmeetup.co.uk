It's an awesome space that we're really lucky to have.
<h2>Directions</h2>
This <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=caledonian+university,+glasgow&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=20.015978,57.084961&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=55.865968,-4.251666&amp;spn=0,359.944253&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=55.865952,-4.251475&amp;panoid=yp5EIqvAGSHx-b6gLahwfA&amp;cbp=12,36.59,,0,5">Google Maps Street View at the entrance to the Caledonian University campus</a> should do the trick -  from that entrance, walk straight ahead and continue up the ramp into the Saltire Centre, which is the glass building just to the right of the building with Caledonian logo on it.  Inside, we'll have signs posted taking you up one floor to the Meetup Space.
