There will be no TechMeetup Aberdeen in December but some people have suggested that we meetup for some drinks and tech chat. So if your interested we will be gathering at Archibald Simpsons on Wednesday 16th December, 18:30 onwards.  Hope to see you there, or in January for the first Tech Meetup Aberdeen of the year.
