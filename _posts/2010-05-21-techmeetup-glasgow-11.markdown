TechMeetup Glasgow is back on the 26th May 2010 with another evening of good tech chat.

<strong>Paul Farley</strong> from <a href="http://www.tag-games.com">Tag Games</a>, will be giving a talk about developing and releasing games for multiple devices and consoles.  Tag Games is an independent game development studio and publisher formed in 2006 by three game industry veterans keen to bring fresh experiences to mobile gaming initially, and then to other platforms.

<strong>If you'd like to give a talk on Wednesday, please get in touch as </strong><strong>we've a second slot <strong>to fill</strong></strong><strong>.</strong>

Talks start 8pm sharpish and we finish up by 10pm. If you’ve never attended a TechMeetup, no worries, you’re totally welcome. It doesn’t cost anything and you don’t need to sign up. Just bring yourself and your inquisitive mind – you’ll find kindred souls talking tech in between bites of pizza and swigs of beer.
