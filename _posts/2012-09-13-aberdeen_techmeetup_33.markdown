This Wednesday, 19 September, at 6:30pm we have a talk on noSQL  lined up for you. We meet at 6:30 in the foyer of the North entrance to the Meston building with talks starting around 7pm.

&nbsp;<b>Andy Cobley</b> <a href="https://fr.twitter.com/AndyCobley">@AndyCobley</a>
In this talk Andy will introduce the need to expand beyond relational databases and SQL.  Why do we need a solution now, after all relational databases have served  us well for 20 years.  Andy will talk about the flood of data we are experiencing, the problems this brings and what solutions there are.  Andy will finish with a quick demo of a NoSQL language and show you whats the same and whats different.

As always, come for the talk and to meet people who share a passion for tech. As always there's also pizza, beer and soft drinks to aid the conversation.
