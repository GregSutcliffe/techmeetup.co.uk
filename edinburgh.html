<h3>Usual Venue</h3>

<p>
	Note that sometimes special events are held at other locations, so always check details for each event. 
	But usually, you'll find us at
	<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Appleton+Tower,+Crichton+Street,+Edinburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=55.944514,-3.186893&amp;spn=0.010009,0.027874&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0">8th floor Appleton Tower</a>.
	There are 2 doors to Appleton Tower, and sometimes you have to try both. 
	You may have to wait at the back door until someone from Techmeetup comes to let you in. 
	Once inside take the lift to the 8th floor. 
	If you are in a big concourse and you aren't sure where the lifts are, they are behind double swing doors on the other side of the concourse.
